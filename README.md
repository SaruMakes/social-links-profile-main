### What I learned

Since I was working with only a design brief and design images for this project (no Figma files), I decided to try to match the sizing of the various parts of the design, but not simply going by eye. Instead I loaded the design image files into Figma, and started drawing semi-transparent boxes on top of the design elements, to get semi-accurate measurements of the elements and gaps between elements. It was very helpful towards getting the basic layout set up, and it is an approach I'll definitely use again in the future. I would like to get better at using Figma though, as I'm sure there's a better way to draw the boxes than how I did it, so that I can actually have Figma simply tell me the layout of the components, padding, etc., instead of me having to do quite a bit of math, to get it all to add up.

Other than that, it was a relatively straightforward project. I did learn to use `height: 100vh;` and the concept of `vh` in general, which I used to fix my issue with the card not centering properly in the viewport. I also learned a bit more about how to work with `<button>`s, and how you generally shouldn't use buttons for external links, as assistive technology allegedly assume that a button will cause changes on the site, rather than simply be a link that's styled as a button.  

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to improve my Figma workflow and skillset, so that I can more easily and quickly recreate designs based solely on design-images. Additionally, I still feel a bit confused as to when I should use `rem` units and when I should use `px` units. There seems to be so many differing opinions out there on what the right thing to do is.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools guide on Button styling](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) - This helped me understand the principles of button styling better.
